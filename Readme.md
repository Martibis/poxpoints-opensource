Bless your soul. Would honestly recommend forgetting you've ever seen this, and just coding it from scratch. If you're not heeding this warning, it is on you. Everything is one-filed, so forget about any architecture, the code is sloppy at best (but it works... sometimes) I'm embarassed having this deployed on my GitHub at all, but I make this sacrifice for the greater good (I think). Have fun.
